# Project Name - Vehicle Spare Parts and Renting Management System for Shantha Motors


# Brief Description of Project -
```
The project is done as per the request of the co-owner of Shantha Motors. The shop is in Mawanella 
with a manager and three other staff members who manage all the activities and transactions 
manually. 

The system is designed to-
➢ Computerize all the functions and transactions of daily activities.
➢ Store data in an efficient manner and to maintain a user and client-friendly environment.

The main problems identified were- 
• Not having a proper storage system for data.
• Details being filled out manually and stored in files, which has caused loss of data.
• Not having a proper billing system and payment method.
• Problems occurred while managing other functionalities such as managing utility bills
inventory control, renting out vehicles, client services, supplier management etc.

We as a team analyzed the client’s requirements and selected this project as the requirements were 
able to be completed within the given time span and due to the vast area of functionalities which 
would help us learn and adapt to the industrial standards. It is also beneficial for the organization 
as the system maintains a proper database where all the data will be stored in one place. It will be 
convenient for the manager to manage and assign functions to the employees from one source, and 
to organize the daily activities in an efficient manner as the system consists of all the management 
functions the client has requested.
